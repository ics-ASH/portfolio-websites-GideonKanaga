    <th><h1>Week 1: Feb 5 - Feb 9</h1><br><h3>This was my first week of this class. We learned about what we could expect to learn in this class and what kind of projects we would be doing. We had a Nokia presentation which was interesting. We also watched a movie which was surprising. It was Hidden Figures and it was about the historical perspective on the contributions of African American women in computing. I found it interesting and overall it was an enjoyable first week. </h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 2: Feb 12 - Feb 16</h1><br><h3>This whole week was focused on setting up our laptops with Visual Studio Code and making sure it was working correctly. We also set up a bunch of accounts for different sites like GitHub and CMU that we would use throughout the semester. Unfortunately for me, the laptop that I had was a Chromebook. It was not as difficult as I thought it would be to fix it. All I had to do was install Linux so I could install VS-Code. We were also introduced to our own websites and set them up. </h3></th>

    <th><h1>Week 3: Feb 19 - Feb 23</h1><br><h3>Monday was Family Day so we had no school. The next day we had our first Tech Tuesday and then worked on Khan Academy and learned about Binary. We also had our first day of CSE where we used a raspberry pi. We did not get to do anything but we were still excited nonetheless. We used Typing Club for the first time, worked on our typing skills, and continued learning binary. </h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 4: Feb 26 - Mar 1</h1><br><h3>We continued learning about Binary at Khan Academy. We also had our second week of Tech Tuesday. We had day 2 of CSE where we were able to finally do some code. My partner and I were able to make a code where it repeatedly typed numbers. Ex. Started at 1 and kept multiplying by 2 each time. We had a Binary Quiz on Friday, I got 25/26 questions correct. </h3></th>

    <th><h1>Week 5: Mar 4 - Mar 8</h1><br><h3>We had our third week of Tech Tuesday and our Third day of CSE. This time we learned the basics of Python such as booleans and variables. The rest of the week we worked on CMU where we learned what was essentially a type of python. We followed the lessons and created different shapes and images. </h3></th>

    <th><h1>Week 7: Mar 18 - Mar 22</h1><br><h3>We updated our websites and added our Tech Tuesday entries. This week's learning focus was on AI. We learned about how it works and where it is used. This was the first week of CSE where we were able to light up the Unicron Hats. We started with very basic programs and slowly made more complicated ones. For the rest of the week, we continued to learn about AI and its implications.</h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 8: Mar 25 - Mar 29</h1><br><h3>We worked on Code HS and learned about AI for the whole week. We learned about real-life examples where it's used such as facial recognition. We watched videos and answered questions about what we had learned. Overall, it helped us learn about the different types of AI, how they work, and where they are used. We learned about their benefits and risks and reflected on them. Friday was Good Friday so we had no class. </h3></th>

    <th><h1>Week 9: Apr 1 - Apr 5</h1><br><h3>Monday was Easter Monday so we had no class. We continued to update our website and add new things that we have learned. We continued with CSE and continued to improve our skills and make better programs. For the rest of the week, we continued with Code HS and continued to learn about AI. We also learned a bit more about the Rasberry Pi’s that we were using for CSE. </h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 10: Apr 8 - Apr 12</h1><br><h3>Monday was a PD so we had no class. We continued with CSE and began using for loops to create changing lights with the Unicron Hat. My and my partner tried new things and were successful. For the rest of the week, we went back to CMU and worked on Unit 1. This is when we were working on our Creative Task for Unit 1. I created a city landscape which you can see in the project section of this website. </h3></th>

We also did CSE and completed some of the Challenges. I was absent on Thursday and Friday for my cousin's wedding. </h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 12: Apr 22 - Apr 26</h1><br><h3>I was absent on Monday for my cousin’s wedding. We had another Tech Tuesday and added our entry to our websites. My partner and I were making good progress at completing the CSE challenges and made our own project for fun. The rest of the week we continued to work on CMU and I completed my Unit 2 creative task which you can see in the class projects section of this website. </h3></th>

    <th><h1>Week 13: Apr 29 - May 3</h1><br><h3>
This week's focus was on hardware. For the first day, we got to take apart old computers and put them back together. We were able to identify the different parts such as the CPU, RAM, HDD, etc. The rest of the week we worked on our hardware project where we had to build our own computer by choosing the parts online. This was fun as we had a lot of freedom for what we could choose and create. </h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 14: May 6 - May 10</h1><br><h3>On Monday we finished and submitted our hardware project. We had our last day of CSE with the people that came in to teach us. At this point, me and my partner have completed all of the challenges. For the rest of the week, we started working on K8, which was a robot that we programed on MicroBIt. It was simple coding like scratch and my group was successful in making it drive. We beat another group in a race. </h3></th>

            <tr>
    <th><h1>Week 15: May 13 - May 17</h1><br><h3>This week we continued working on K8 and made it remote controlled. We faced some issues but realized it was not our fault our batteries were just dead. We were successful and were able to move in all directions and used the servo to move a pencil up and down. The pencil and the pin and our goal was to use it to pop the other team’s balloons in the battle royale. On the last day, we made a CMU project involving K8. You can see it in the class projects section of this website. </h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 16: May 20 - May 24</h1><br><h3>Monday was Victoria day so we had no class. We worked on our K8s and also decorated the wall for the area. We had our last CSE day where we worked on our own and had to make a fun project. There was a lot of freedom which made it fun because we finally got to choose what we wanted to make. For the rest of the week, we continued to work on our K8’s. </h3></th>

    <th><h1>Week 17: May 27 - May 31</h1><br><h3>On Monday we had the Battle Royale with the K8 robots. Overall it was fun even though we were not as successful as we hoped. This was because the pins were not sharp enough to pop the balloons properly. We had our final Tech Tuesday and added it to our website. For the rest of the week, we worked on our websites. </h3></th>
    <th><h1>Week 18: Jun 3 - Jun 7</h1><br><h3>This week’s focus was on AI. Like earlier, we used Code HS and learned about AI. We learned about Large Language Models and how to better use them. For example, we learned about prompt specialization and how we can get better results. At the end of the week, we worked on our AI detectives project and created presentations. </h3></th>

    <th><h1>Week 19: Jun 10 - Jun 14</h1><br><h3>Me and my group were second to present our AI detectives project. We continued with presentations until Wednesday. Then we worked on our websites and added new things that we learned. On Friday, we went outside to pull weeds out and make the front of the school look better. It was great weather making it an enjoyable experience.</h3>
